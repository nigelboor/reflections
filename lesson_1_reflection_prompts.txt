How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Focuses on changed so you don't need to trawl through the whole file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Means you can roll back or compare changes to see what woks better

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you pick the points that are logical to you
    Cons: you might miss a change that is significant

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Multiple files are necessary with projects like web apps
    Single files work well with traditional documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Log shows all the commit IDs, messages and times
    Diff shows line by line differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's possible to roll back to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Track projects & keep versions online (GitHub)
